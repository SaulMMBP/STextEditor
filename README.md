This project is an basic text editor as practice at the coding of GUI application. It has a menu and tool bar, with submenus and items like
simple options, options with checkbox and radiobuttons on groups. It has too a popup menu with some of the options of Edicion menu. I use events listeners

button component in the toolbar.
